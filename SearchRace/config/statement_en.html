      <div class="statement-rules-content">
        You are controlling a car racing through a series of checkpoints. Each checkpoint is located on position indicated with <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>.
        Which checkpoint to target is given by <var>checkpointId</var> pointing to a value in the checkpoints given as initial input.
        <br>
        <br>
        Checkpoints are repeated when given as inputs. (in difference to CSB)
        <br>
        The game is played on a map <const>16000</const> units wide and <const>9000</const> units high. The coordinate X=0, Y=0 is the top left pixel.
        <br>
        <br>
        The checkpoints work as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>The checkpoints are circular, with a radius of 600 units.</li>
          <li>The disposition of the checkpoints are set by the testcases.</li>
          <li>No checkpoints are overlapping.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        The car work as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Every turn it takes a new command given a position and a <var>THRUST</var> indicating where to drive.</li>
          <li>It will at max turn 18 degrees from where the current heading are.</li>
          <li>When the heading is set, car uses the given <var>thrust</var> to drive in the new direction.</li>
          <li>To enter a checkpoint, the center of a car must be within <const>600</const> units of the checkpoints center.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        You <strong>lose</strong> if:
        <ul>
          <li>You use more than 600 rounds.</li>
          <li>You do not supply a valid action.</li>
        </ul>

        You <strong>win</strong> if:
        <ul>
          <li>You visit all checkpoints as given by inputs before the time is out!</li>
        </ul>

    </h1>
    <div class="statement-expert-rules-content">
      On each turn the car movement are computed this way:
      <ul>
        <li>The car rotates to face the target point, with a maximum of 18 degrees.</li>
        <li>The car's facing vector is multiplied by the given thrust value. The result is added to the current speed vector.</li>
        <li>The speed vector is added to the position of the car.</li>
        <li>The current speed vector is multiplied by 0.85</li>
        <li>The speed's values are truncated, angles converted to degrees and rounded and the position's values are rounded to the nearest integer.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Angle are provided in degrees, and relative to the x axis.
